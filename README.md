# Python Foundational Projects

Welcome to my collection of foundational Python projects, developed before starting university. These projects showcase fundamental programming concepts including sequences, calculations, and recursion â€” essential building blocks for any aspiring software developer.

## Projects Included

### 1. Sequence Analyzer  
A class-based program that determines whether a sequence of numbers is arithmetic, geometric, or neither. It also computes the sequence's partial sums and handles basic input validation.

### 2. Calculator  
A multi-functional calculator supporting operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, roots, factorial, trigonometric functions, and logarithms. This project demonstrates recursion (factorial) and usage of Python's `math` library.

### 3. Fibonacci Generator  
Generates Fibonacci sequences up to a user-defined length and calculates partial sums of the sequence. This program emphasizes iterative list building and basic user interaction.

## How to Use

Each project can be run independently by executing the Python scripts. They are designed for console interaction and provide prompts for user input.

## Why These Projects Matter

- Reinforce object-oriented programming principles  
- Practice input validation and error handling  
- Apply recursion and iteration effectively  
- Gain familiarity with mathematical operations in Python  

## Next Steps

These projects laid the foundation for more complex work, including a cybersecurity-focused project and a Python game built with Tkinter, both available in my portfolio.
